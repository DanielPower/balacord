# Privacy Policy for Balacord

*Last Updated: May 20, 2025*

This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you use Balacord (the "Bot").

## Information We Collect

When you use the Bot, we collect certain information, including:

1. **Discord Server IDs**: We collect server IDs to store server-specific preferences, such as language settings.

2. **User IDs**: We collect user IDs to associate actions with specific users for analytics purposes.

3. **Message Content**: The Bot scans messages to identify text within double brackets (e.g., `((Fibonacci))`). Only this specific text is extracted and stored for analytics purposes and to provide the joker card embedding functionality. All other message content is immediately discarded and never stored.

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:

- Provide, maintain, and improve the Bot's functionality
- Analyze usage patterns to enhance user experience
- Respond to user inquiries and support requests
- Monitor and prevent unauthorized or illegal activities

## Data Retention

We retain the collected data for as long as necessary to provide you with the Bot's services. If you remove the Bot from your server, we may continue to store certain information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

## Data Security

We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the personal information we collect and process. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Third-Party Services

The Bot operates through Discord's platform and API. Your use of Discord is governed by Discord's own [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy).

## Children's Privacy

The Bot is not intended for individuals under the age of 13, in compliance with Discord's Terms of Service. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will delete that information.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes to our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will post the updated Privacy Policy on our GitHub repository.

## Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights concerning your personal data, such as the right to access, correct, or delete your personal information. To exercise these rights, please contact us.
